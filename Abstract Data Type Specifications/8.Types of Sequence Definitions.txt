2 parameters of a sequence :   type of element,  number of elements        
// we need to know atleast 1 parameter, i.e. arbitrary type and arbitrary size of sequence cannot be defined

// note that first pair of angle brackets are of typedef, they are unrelated to sequences (     typedef< >   )

//   all elements same type       arbitrary length
abstract typedef<  <type>  > seq1

//   all elements same type       fixed length
abstract typedef<  <type, n>  > seq2

// each element different type   	fixed length
abstract typedef<  type1, type2, type3, type4, ... , typen  > seq3

// each element different type             arbitrary length
cannot be defined, since for knowing type of each element we need to know number of elements. 
for this, you need to take some parameter as argument to seuence type from user, like how stack is parameterized in its definition
