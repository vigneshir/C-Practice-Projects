Programs for evaluating the value of infix, postfix and prefix expressions 
run into errors on successive runs after saying 'yes'.

Perhaps some problem with %s not taking input with spaces or
some '\n' remaining in the input buffer or 
some unnecessary space considered at start of entered expression.
